When the controller manager loads a controller, it is in the stopped state. You need to explicitly start it to transition to a running state. You can check a controller's state by calling /controller_manager/list_controllers

This the usual flow:

Load a controller: Use the /controller_manager/load_controller service

Precondition: Controller config loaded in the ROS param server.
Effect: Calls the controller's init(...) method.
Postcondition: Controller is loaded, but stopped.
Start a controller: Use the /controller_manager/switch_controller service (start_controllers field)

Precondition: Controller already loaded and stopped. Resources to claim are available.
Effect: Calls the controller's starting(...) method
Postcondition: Running controller.
Stop a controller: Use the /controller_manager/switch_controller service (stop_controllers field)

Precondition: Controller is running.
Effect: Calls the controller's stopping(...) method
Postcondition: Stopped (but still loaded) controller.
Unload a controller: Use the /controller_manager/load_controller service

Precondition: Controller is stopped.
Effect: Calls controller destructor.
Postcondition: Controller no longer managed by the controller_manager.
